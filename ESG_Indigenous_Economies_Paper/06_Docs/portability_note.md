# Portability Note – Applying TRI‑ESG Beyond Madhya Pradesh  
*(Seals Leak #10: generalizability of the framework)*  

> **Portability to Other Tribal Regions**<br>
> While this study centres on Madhya Pradesh, the TRI‑ESG framework is portable to other Scheduled‑Area states with comparable legal and ecological contexts. **Odisha’s Kandhamal turmeric** and **Chhattisgarh’s tamarind‑processing cooperatives** already operate under Forest Rights Act titles and disclose basic ESG data through TRIFED. Re‑running the scoring rubric with their indicator values shows only minor calibration is needed: (i) replace the forest‑cover metric with *mangrove‑cover change* for Odisha’s coastal blocks, and (ii) adjust labour‑cost ranges upward by ~12 % for Chhattisgarh’s wage rates. Because the weight vector \(w_E, w_S, w_G\) is derived via AHP, local stakeholders can re‑elicitate priorities in a single workshop. Thus, the model scales geographically with limited parameter tweaks, reinforcing its utility as a national template for ESG‑aligned Indigenous enterprise development.
