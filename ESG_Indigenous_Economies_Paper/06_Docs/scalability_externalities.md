7.4 General-Equilibrium & Scalability Externalities
While the TRI-ESG optimisation treats each tribal practice as an independent module, real-world scaling introduces second-order effects that can erode net impact. First, rapid uptake of any one forest-based enterprise (e.g., bamboo crafts) may saturate local markets, depressing prices and shifting labour away from non-model livelihoods. Second, resource competition can emerge: expanding mahua collection beyond a threshold may reduce flowering biomass available to pollinators, thereby lowering aggregate net-carbon benefits. Third, social capital dilution can occur if external investors impose governance templates that crowd out customary norms. To acknowledge these externalities, we (i) cap model expansion at 40 % of district harvest potential per NTFP, (ii) flag any scenario where combined labour demand exceeds 60 % of the active tribal workforce, and (iii) recommend an iterative recalibration every two years, adjusting indicator scores and weights as market and ecological feedback loops manifest. Future work should model cross-elasticities explicitly and couple the TRI-ESG engine with a dynamic systems model of district-level land-use change.
